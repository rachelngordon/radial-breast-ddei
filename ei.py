class EILoss(Loss):
    r"""
    Equivariant imaging self-supervised loss.

    Assumes that the set of signals is invariant to a group of transformations (rotations, translations, etc.)
    in order to learn from incomplete measurement data alone https://https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14756.pdf.

    The EI loss is defined as

    .. math::

        \| T_g \hat{x} - \inverse{\forw{T_g \hat{x}}}\|^2


    where :math:`\hat{x}=\inverse{y}` is a reconstructed signal and
    :math:`T_g` is a transformation sampled at random from a group :math:`g\sim\group`.

    By default, the error is computed using the MSE metric, however any other metric (e.g., :math:`\ell_1`)
    can be used as well.

    :param deepinv.transform.Transform transform: Transform to generate the virtually augmented measurement.
        It can be any torch-differentiable function (e.g., a :class:`torch.nn.Module`)
        including `torchvision transforms <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html>`_.
    :param Metric, torch.nn.Module metric: Metric used to compute the error between the reconstructed augmented measurement and the reference
        image.
    :param bool apply_noise: if ``True``, the augmented measurement is computed with the full sensing model
        :math:`\sensor{\noise{\forw{\hat{x}}}}` (i.e., noise and sensor model),
        otherwise is generated as :math:`\forw{\hat{x}}`.
    :param float weight: Weight of the loss.
    :param bool no_grad: if ``True``, the gradient does not propagate through :math:`T_g`. Default: ``False``.
        This option is useful for super-resolution problems, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11232.
